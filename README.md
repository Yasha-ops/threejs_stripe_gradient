# Threejs stripe gradient
This project is a simple implementation of the gradient effect from Stripes.com using Three.js, Three Fiber, and GLSL.

Please note that this is a small and basic project, and the code quality may not be up to industry standards. Additionally, there are many other ways to achieve this effect, but this is one approach.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own project, or to experiment with and improve the code.

# Usage
```
npm install
npm run start
```
